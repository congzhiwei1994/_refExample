---------------------------------
DESCRIPTION
---------------------------------
GPU Instancer is an out of the box solution to display extreme numbers of objects on screen with high performance. 
With a few mouse clicks, you can instance your prefabs and Unity terrain details and trees.

GPU Instancer provides user friendly tools to allow everyone to use Indirect GPU Instancing without having to go through 
the deep learning curve of Compute Shaders and GPU infrastructure. Also, an API with extensive documentation is provided 
to manage runtime changes.

To provide the fastest possible performance, GPU Instancer utilizes Indirect GPU Instancing using Unity's 
DrawMeshInstancedIndirect method and Compute Shaders.

GPU Instancing results in magnitudes of performance improvement over static batching and mesh combining. Also, other available 
solutions for GPU Instancing (including Unity's material option and the DrawMeshInstanced method) fail short on limited buffer 
sizes and therefore result in more draw calls and less performance. By using the indirect method GPU Instancer aims to provide 
the ultimate solution for this, and increases performance considerably while rendering the same mesh multiple times.

GPU Instancer consists of three main Monobehavior classes named "GPU Instancer Prefab Manager", "GPU Insancer Detail Manager" and  "GPU Insancer Tree Manager".

GPU Instancer Prefab Manager
---------------------------------
By adding your prefabs to the Prefab Manager, the prefab instances you add to your scenes are automatically rendered by GPU Instancer.
It also provides additional functionality such as adding/removing instances at runtime, changing material properties per instance, 
and enabling/disabling GPU Instancing and Rigidbodies on instanced objects (at a specified area) at runtime.

Note that prefab manager only accepts user created prefabs. It will not accept prefabs that are generated when importing your 3D model assets.

GPU Instancer Detail Manager
---------------------------------
Detail Manager takes over rendering of detail prototypes added to your Unity terrain.
It comes with a grass shader which gives you the ability to customize how your grass will look on your terrain with a set of shader 
properties that can be edited from the manager.

GPU Instancer Tree Manager
---------------------------------
Tree Manager takes over rendering of tree prototypes added to your Unity terrain. Billboards are automatically generated for Trees and added as the 
final LOD level in the prototype's rendering pipeline.

---------------------------------

---------------------------------
DEMO SCENES
---------------------------------
You can find demo scenes that showcase GPU Instancer capabilities in the "GPUInstancer/Demos" folder. 
These scenes are only for demonstration and you can safely remove this folder from your builds.
Some demos also have a "PostProcessing" folder. For best visual results, you can add a "Post-Processing Behavior" 
script to the scene cameras and add the setting object to this script from this folder.

SRP NOTE: If you are using URP or HDRP, you can extract the corresponding override packages under the "GPUInstancer/Demos/" 
folder to view the demo scenes in your project. For more information, please check the "Demo_Packages_SRP-Readme" file under the same folder.
