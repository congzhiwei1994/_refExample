1.1.0

Added:
- Colormap Renderer can now also render a scale map for grass, based on terrain layers. Allows grass scale to be determined by painted terrain layer strength.
	Material now has a Vector3 field to control the scale influence for the XYZ axis. The "Apply scalemap" toggle must be enabled on a material.
- "Shadow banding correction" toggle. Offsets the shadows received by the grass a tiny bit. This avoids unwanted self-shadowing (aka shadow acne).
- Support for LOD dithered crossfading (requires to be enabled on LOD group)

Changed:
- Height offset for mesh grass benders is now also applied to the wireframe gizmo
- Active color map is now re-assigned whenever scene is saved, to avoid the link to the shader being broken
- "Bending" section in material UI was renamed to "Vertices".
- Bending render area edge masking now also works when not in play-mode.
- Added additional edge loop to LOD0 of meshes. Added a LOD2 mesh with fewer vertices.

Fixed:
- Color Map Renderer
	* Render area calculations when terrains have a negative position
	* Handling cases where terrains are entirely flat
- (Preemptive) Warning about obsolete method in URP 9.0.0+ (2020.2)
- Shader error in URP 9.0.0, due to changes in URP lighting functions.
- Environment reflections not correct when a normal map was used on curved meshes.

Removed:
- Specular highlight parameter, this was broken to begin with and translucency ends up offering the same visual result.

Note: Prefabs in Vegetation Studio Pro have to be refreshed to avoid shadow flickering issues

1.0.9
Verified compatibility with URP 7.4.1

Added:
- Support for Nature Renderer's "Procedural Instancing".
	* An option has been added at the bottom of the grass material to switch between Vegetation Studio and Nature Renderer integrations
- "GrassSingle" model/prefab. A version of the GrassPatch prefab but with a single tuft.

Changed:
- Revised demo scene
- When using the Simple Lighting mode, the color map is now also sampled per-pixel (texture would otherwise multiple over it)

Fixed:
- Bending area being flipped in URP 7.4.1
- Scenario where objects other than terrains could be rendered into the color map
- Sun light adding additional light when at a steep angle, causing color map to not match up with terrain
- Translucency now handles HDR light colors better

1.0.8

Changed:
- Bending renderer now moves to follow target transform intermittently, rather than constantly. This eliminates any possible movement flickering in the grass.
- Corrected settings for BendParticles prefab, it can now also be used as a child object.
- Wind gust tint no longer applies to emission, so will respond correctly to lower direct light intensity (eg. dawn/dusk/night)

Added:
- Wheat texture and prefab
- Thin grass texture and prefab
- StylizedGrassRenderer script now has a static SetPosition(Vector3 position) function

1.0.7
Minimum required URP version: 7.2.0. Tested in 7.2.1/7.3.1/8.0.1

Added:
- Alpha to coverage toggle to shader, reduces aliasing when using MSAA
- Thick grass texture and prefab

Changed:
- Wind gust tint is now applied after translucency, resulting in more natural lighting behaviour.
- Set all grass textures to "Clamp" to avoid thin lines at tip of grass at lower mipmaps
- Expanded state of material sections are now saved until Unity is closed

1.0.6
Minimum required URP version: 7.2.0. Tested in 7.2.1/7.3.1/8.0.1

Added:
- Perspective Correction parameter. Controls the amount by which the grass is gradually bent away from the camera as it looks down. Useful for better coverage in top-down perspectives

Changed:
- Improved visual quality of demo scenes through added color grading LUT and skybox

Fixed:
- Bug when using an override texture on a color map asset would cause it to be modified when re-rendering
- Bug where grass would still sample a color map when switching to a scene without one active
- Deleted hidden cameras from demo scenes, which caused a significant performance drop (development remnants)
- Bright pixels at tip of grass in situations where translucency is prominent and MSAA is used.
- Bending render area being flipped in URP 7.3.1

1.0.5
Minimum required URP version: 7.2.0. URP 7.3.1 compatibility verified. 

Note: Color maps have to be re-rendered in order to update their information to a new format!

Changed:
- Color map textures are now compressed, resulting in a substantial memory saving.

Fixed:
- Errors thrown on the ColorMapRenderer component when no ColorMap asset was assigned
- Bending render area being flipped in URP 7.3.1 (Make up your mind, Unity!)

1.0.4
URP version requirement: 7.2.0+

Added:
- Sorting layer to Grass Bender component. Higher layers are drawn over lower layers. Can be used to control which benders should overwrite other benders.
- Particle trail prefab, as an alternative to using a grass bender with a trail renderer.
- Color map height parameter, allows the color map to only take effect at the root of a grass mesh

Changed:
- Grass benders using a particle system in World simulation space are now supported
- Grass benders outside of the render area are no longer processed

Fixed:
- URP installation dialog not having any effect due to changes in the Package Manager
- Color map not rendering correctly if terrains were moved away from the world origin
- (Preemptive fix) Grass bending render area being flipped in URP 8.0.1+ (Apparently was a mistake in 7.2.0)

1.0.3
Changed:
- Translucency color is now mixed with grass color through overlay blending, instead of directly using the sun color. 
  A white directional light on green grass results in a yellow-ish tint, as expected.

Fixed:
- Renderer component incorrectly displaying an error regarding URP installation
- Added missing materials for Alien and Tall grass prefabs
- Grass bending render area being flipped (Occurs since URP 7.2.0)
- Error on MacOS when using OpenGL regarding unsupported render texture format

1.0.2
Package now requires Universal Render Pipeline 7.2.0+

If the package is imported without the URP installed, a dialog will now open with the option to install it.

Fixed:
- Dark edge showing at borders of shadow cascades (Occurs since URP 7.2.0)
- Warning in Lighting shader library

1.0.1
Added:
- Grass Renderer component now has a WindZone field. When enabled, ambient and gust strength are influenced by its "Main" value

Changed:
- Wind tint is now masked by shadows
- Translucency effect now fades out when Directional Light approaches to the horizon
- Shader UI will show warnings about reflection settings when incompatible scene lighting settings are used

Fixed:
- Tiling/Offset values for normal map had no effect
- Color map rendering from mesh terrains can now automatically calculate the correct render area size

1.0.0
Initial version
