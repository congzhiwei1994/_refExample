## Getting started

- Make sure you have a suitable version of Lux URP Essentials imported. In case you do not use the latest version of URP you may have to import one of the included packages for older versions of URP.

- As some of the advanced materials (like water or glass) provided by Lux URP Essentials depend on the "Depth Texture" and "Opaque Texture" being available you have to activate both:
Open the Scriptable Render Pipeline Settings assigned under Project Settings â†’
Graphics and check "Depth Texture" and the "Opaque Texture". If you check "Opaque Downsample" or not is up to you.
